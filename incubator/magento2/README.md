Persistence
'''''''''''

There are two storage APIs in Kubernetes that handle persistence abstraction:

- volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class
- volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class

These APIs have different behaviours, across different cluster versions. The alpha API will be used if a storage class 
is not specified in the `storageClass` input, as it defers storage to to the cluster and the cluster will provision 
some based on its configured defaults. However, if the administrator needs to provision this storage (such as in the 
local development environment), they should set the `storageClass` attribute to match their configured storage, after
which the beta API will be used.
