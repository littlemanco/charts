# Todo: This is just design at the moment. I don't quite know how it'll all get executed.
#
# This initialises vault, connects it to ETCD and sets up a PKI backend to issue certificates. 
# The certificates are then stored in Kubernetes secrets, this vault instance destroyed and other
# vault instances spun up to connect used on the SSL certificates generated by this job initially.
#
# Notes:
#  - The Kubernetes certificates can probably be generated by the kubectl sidecar
#  - The script might be able to be execited in a sidecar also, leaving the vault
#    server as the official hashicorp container
